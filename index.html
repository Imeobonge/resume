        creativity and functionality. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS and Javascript , I bring websites to life, making
        them not just visually appealing but also user-friendly and efficient. I am also into Website Maintenance and
        management</p>
    <p> My journey in web development started 5 years ago, and I've been fortunate to work on a diverse range of
        projects, from personal blogs to complex e-commerce websites. I thrive on turning ideas into reality, solving
        problems with elegant solutions, and staying up-to-date with the ever-evolving web technologies.</p>
